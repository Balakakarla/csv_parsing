# csv_parsing
# Objective:
To develop an application that can perform statistical analysis of CSV files using the Prompt and
Llama-2 model, and generate plots based on the results.

# Assignment:
Develop an application that can perform statistical analysis of CSV files using the Prompt and LLM
model, and generate plots based on the results. The application should be able to:
● Read and parse CSV files
● Perform basic statistical analysis on the data, such as calculating the mean, median, mode,
standard deviation, and correlation coefficient
● Generate plots of the data, such as histograms, scatter plots, and line plots etc.,
● Answer questions about the data in a comprehensive and informative way

# Requirements:
The application should be developed using the following technologies. Feel free to use any method.
● Python, Prompt
● Any LLM
● Matplotlib
● Pandas


# Deliverables:
● The deliverables for this project include:
● A working application that can perform statistical analysis of CSV files and generate plots
● A demonstration of the application in action
● A report that describes the design and implementation of the application
